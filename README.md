## Description

<details>
  <summary>Open Description</summary>
  
  The Enderite Mod adds new armor and tools, which are successors of Netherite tools.
Enderite ore can be found in the End and needs to be blown up before it can be mined.
You can smelt the ore in a blast furnace to get scraps, which can be craft with diamonds to Enderite Ingots (similar to Netherite).
With these ingots you can craft Enderite tools and blocks, which all have the void floating ability.

### Void floating ability

- no gravity
- they avoid the void (y<0) and float above it, even after a player fell out of the world
- fireproof (like netherite)

### Special items/blocks

- **Enderite Ore**: can only be mined after it was cracked through an explosion (heights 12-48 in the End)
- **Enderite Shulker Box**: safer alternative to normal shulker box (survives the void and is fireproof)
- **Enderite Respawn Anchor**: allows respawns in the End (charged with ender pearls)
- **Enderite Sword**: Can be charged with ender pearls in the smithing table, lets you teleport with sneak + right click if charged
- **Enderite Helmet**: prevents Enderman from getting aggressive towards you when looking at them
- **Enderite Elytra Chestplate**: Enderite Chestplate fused with the Elytra, provides armor and Eyltra flight
- **Enderite Bow/Crossbow**: Are able to shoot Enderman
